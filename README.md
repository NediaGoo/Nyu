<h2 align="left"> So now, what is NyumatFlix? </h2>

<b><p align="left"> NyumatFlix is a free movie and tv show streaming platform. You can stream and download whatever TV epsiode or movie, all according to the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) </p></b>


<h2 align="left"> Why?</h2>

<p align="left"> As a college student, money is scarce. Nowadays, it seeems like you need four seperate subsriptions to the popular streaming services just to keep up with all the shows/movies you'd like to see!</p>

<b><p align="left"> So naturally, I just had to make my own site.</p></b>

<p align="left">Growing up, I used sites such as soap2day and 123movies. However, I quickly found those sites to be infested with ads and viruses. You may say yeah, the bills have to be paid...but, what if I told you we could remove all of those risks?</p>

<h2 align="left">Inception</h2>

<p align="left"> And that's where NyumatFlix comes in. This term, I'm taking a web development course and wanted to explore what Web Dev really is all about.</p>

<br>

<p align="left">I creatd my first TypeScript and React project about a week ago, which was just a simple guessing game. I'm the type to learn a framework and just start building, so that's exactly what I did.</p>


<h2 align="left"> The API</h2>

<p align="left"> You've probably heard of the movie databse before. It's th most popular REST api for querying data on any movie, really ever. I've used it in both Python and Swift before and wanted to see the actual data displayed so I used my newfound TypeScript and React hook (pun intended) üòè I had to create something where I could display the information.</p>

<h2 align="left">Demo </h2>

<p align="left">I could ramble about this in the README for pretty much forever, as I don't have a Youtube channel or TikTok (anymore, rip TTB üò¢) so I'm going to put the Demo's in this Readme!</p>

<b><p align="left"> I'm not a pro in CSS or UI/UX Design my any means, but I tried to makee the UI as friendly as possible. Let's check it out!</p></b>
